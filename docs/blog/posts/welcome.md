Hello, and welcome to one of the most exciting learning journeys at Amirkabir University of Technology—**Fundamentals of Computer and Programming in C**! I am thrilled to have the opportunity to guide you through the fascinating world of computing and programming, a cornerstone of modern innovation.

This course is specially designed to lay a solid foundation for your programming skills, starting with the basics and gradually delving into advanced concepts. Whether you're new to programming or looking to strengthen your understanding, this course will provide you with the tools and confidence to think like a computer scientist. From mastering decision-making and loops to exploring pointers, data structures, and file handling, we’ll unravel the secrets of problem-solving and algorithmic thinking together.

Our approach blends theory with hands-on practice to ensure you gain practical skills that are directly applicable to real-world challenges. Along the way, you'll be engaging in projects, exploring case studies, and applying your knowledge to build efficient, modular, and maintainable programs. All of this will be guided by the renowned textbook *C How to Program* by Paul Deitel and Harvey Deitel, which serves as our anchor throughout the course.

Beyond programming, this course aims to foster your curiosity, creativity, and critical thinking—skills that will prove invaluable not just in computer science but in countless other fields. You’ll also find a community here that encourages collaboration, questions, and growth.

I’m eager to see each of you thrive, and I look forward to supporting you as we tackle this adventure together. Let’s code, learn, and make a difference. Welcome aboard!  

Here’s to an amazing semester!  

Warm regards,
