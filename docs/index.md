# Fundamentals of Computer and Programming Course


This course, "Fundamentals of Computer and Programming in C," at [Amirkabir University of Technology](http://ce.aut.ac.ir){ target="_blank" } provides a comprehensive introduction to the principles of computing and structured programming using the C language. It is designed to equip students with essential programming skills, covering topics like decision-making, loops, functions, arrays, pointers, and file handling. The course emphasizes problem-solving and algorithmic thinking, enabling students to develop efficient, modular, and maintainable programs. Additionally, students will explore foundational concepts in data structures, dynamic memory management, and advanced programming techniques. By the end of the course, participants will be proficient in applying C programming to solve real-world problems and prepare for further studies in computer science.
